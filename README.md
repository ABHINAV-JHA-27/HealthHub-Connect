Patients will be able to browse through the doctor profiles, read reviews, and select the most suitable doctor for their needs. The appointment booking process will be simplified, allowing patients to choose a convenient time slot and receive confirmation notifications.

The app will also incorporate a live chat feature, enabling patients to connect with doctors directly for consultations. This feature will be particularly beneficial for minor ailments, follow- up appointments, and quick medical advice. Doctors will be able to respond to patients' queries promptly, providing reassurance and guidance. -->
